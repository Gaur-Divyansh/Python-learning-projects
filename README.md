# 🐍 Python Projects – Learn by Building

A curated collection of Python projects I'm creating as I learn and apply programming concepts.

## 📌 What's inside:
- 📚 Fundamental Python concepts (variables, OOP, file handling, etc.)
- 🛠️ Hands-on mini projects 
- 🚀 A growth log of my journey to master Python

Each folder contains:
- ✅ Clean, commented code
- 📝 Explanation of the logic and approach(maybe)

---

📖 **Goal**: To solidify my understanding of Python by building real, useful things — one project at a time.
